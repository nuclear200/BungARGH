uhhhh..... sooooo....
u go like "app.exe data" to build the internal db cuz is faster
it takes in input a file that has this format https://github.com/SoZ0/destiny2-2025-community-puzzle-tjil-to-fen/blob/main/output/verified/sequence_map.json
and that u go like "app.exe {freq}" and it plots a map of the freqs with common edges... 
it needs polish.... but i may be a bit sleep deprived... so it works enough XD
