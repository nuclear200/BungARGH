<s>uhhhh..... sooooo....
u go like "app.exe data" to build the internal db cuz is faster
it takes in input a file that has this format https://github.com/SoZ0/destiny2-2025-community-puzzle-tjil-to-fen/blob/main/output/verified/sequence_map.json
and that u go like "app.exe {freq}" and it plots a map of the freqs with common edges... 
it needs polish.... but i may be a bit sleep deprived... so it works enough XD</s>

turns out that sleep deprivation is bad, and now i have realized how inefficient this is.... (00.00 cet may 1)

I'll probably at some point start update this thing just as an exercise, but for now we can mark this as abandoned
